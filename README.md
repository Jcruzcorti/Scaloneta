# Welcome to Quiz Scaloneta!

The project consists of a quiz game about the Argentine national football team.


## Project details:
The web, consists of a home page, in which they are with a button to start the game, which pressing it starts the game. Then the player has 120 seconds to answer the total of 15 questions about the Scaloneta (nickname of the Argentina National Team led by DT Lionel Scaloni). If the time available ends, as well as if the player finishes the questionnaire, a button appears to know the result, which directs to a modal in which the player has to attach his name in order to know his score. When sending the modal, both the player's name and score are automatically sent to Firestore/Firebase to record the data in question.
